# order-matching-system
Simple limit order matching system written in C++.

At the moment, the basic functionality works. There are obvious improvements to be made with respect to choosing optimal data structures - hence performance right now is pitiful. However, it was a good refresher on C++. To add:

 - Faster data structures (priority queue?).
 - ID field for orders
 - Trade should display the IDs of both orders.
 - Cancel orders by providing an ID.
 - Better error handling,
 - Documentation for code.
 - More flexible I/O options.
 - FIFO and Pro-Rata options choice.
